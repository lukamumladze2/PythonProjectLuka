    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the pancetta or guanciale and garlic. Cook until the fat is rendered, and the meat is crispy. Remove the garlic and discard.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous amount of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is done, reserve a cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti and add it to the skillet with the pancetta. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Quickly add the egg mixture to the pasta, tossing well to combine. The heat from the pasta cooks the eggs, creating a creamy sauce. Add a bit of reserved pasta water if the sauce is too thick.</li>
        <li>Season with more black pepper and serve immediately, topped with additional grated cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>
